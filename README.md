Welcome to DeFi Dashboard Project.

1) Firstly, you have to have vanilla python installed.
  In case of Anaconda you have to install individual packages your self.

2) Move to dashboard root directory.

3) Use "pip install -r requirements.txt" in the terminal.
   In case of Anaconda installation make sure you have installed requests
   and flask libraries.

4) Get your api-key from https://data.defipulse.com/ by creating free account.

5) Copy given api-key to the file config.ini.
   Make sure you are copying only the api-key without quotes.
   If you do not have a coinmarketcap api-key not to worry. You do not need it
   for now. We will include functionality based on this api-key in the future.
